# RDTNet:  Residual Deformable Attention based Transformer Network for Breast Cancer Classification

<p align="justify"> This paper proposes a residual deformable attention based transformer network (RDTNet) for breast cancer 
histopathological image classification. The RDTNet is an end-to-end architecture which is composed of three
key components: a backbone network, a residual deformable transformer layer (RDTL) and a classifier. The RDTL
introduces a multi-head deformable self-attention (MDSA) module which leverages the extraction of salient and 
category-specific features from the crucial regions of the histopathological images. In addition, it utilizes 
skip connections for better feature flow within the network. </p>
